# Learning Guide

## Teaching Approach

1. **Start concrete**: Show a working example from this codebase first, then explain the concept.
2. **Progressive complexity**: Simple case → edge cases → advanced patterns.
3. **Use project context**: Reference actual files (e.g., `src/app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx`) rather than abstract examples.
4. **Explain the "why"**: Don't just show what — explain why this pattern exists and what problem it solves.

## Tech Context

This project uses Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript (strict), Tailwind CSS v4, and Framer Motion. Ground all explanations in this stack.

## Format

- Keep explanations concise.
- Use code snippets from the actual codebase when possible.
- Highlight common mistakes and how to avoid them.
- Link to official docs when relevant (nextjs.org, react.dev, tailwindcss.com).
