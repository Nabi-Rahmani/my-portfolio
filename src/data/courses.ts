Hey, I'm Nabi, your instructor for this course!

I created this course because **shipping mobile apps is hard**, and there are many things to consider:

- **Preparing for release**: app icons, splash screens, flavors, environments, error reporting, analytics, force update, privacy, T&Cs.
- **App Submissions**: app store metadata & screenshots, compliance, testing vs distribution tracks, dealing with rejections.
- **Release automation:** CI workflows, environment variables, custom build steps, code signing, uploading to the stores.
- **Post-release**: error monitoring, bug fixes, addressing user feedback, over-the-air updates, feature toggles & A/B testing.

## Course Structure

To help you tackle all these challenges, I've created a comprehensive curriculum that is divided into three parts.

### Part 1: Preparing for Release (Modules 2-8)

In this first part, you'll get your app ready for production by tackling:

- **Launcher Icons and Splash Screens**
- **Multiple Flavors and Environments**
- **Error Monitoring** (Sentry)
- **Analytics** (Mixpanel and Firebase Analytics)
- **Force Update** (Firebase Remote Config)
- **Collecting user feedback and in-app reviews**
- **Creating a website for your app**

Skipping these steps can be costly. Imagine releasing without error monitoring or analytics—you'd be **flying blind**. What if there's a critical bug in production? Or if a feature you spent weeks on isn't even being used? This section ensures you're equipped to avoid those headaches.

### Part 2: Release Management and Automation (Modules 9-12)

Once your app is ready, it's time to get it into users' hands. This part covers:

- **App Store Release**: Prepare, build, upload, and submit your iOS app to App Store Connect
- **Play Store Release**: Prepare, build, upload, and submit your Android app to the Google Play Store

Once your first release is out, you'll quickly find that manual releases take a lot of time, so you'll want to automate the whole process:

- **Release Automation with Codemagic** (quick setup).
- **Release Automation with GitHub Actions + Fastlane** (advanced setup with more control).

**Bonus**: I'll also walk you through the latest requirements for setting up Apple/Google developer accounts and navigating store policies.

### Part 3: Post-Release Techniques (Modules 13-15)

By this stage, you'll be confident about shipping and monitoring your apps in production. Time to streamline your process even further:

- **Code push with Shorebird**
- **Automated screenshots generation**
- **Feature toggles and A/B Testing**

### What is not included in this course

There are some topics that, while important for production apps, are not planned for this course:

- **Automated testing**
- **Accessibility and localization**
- **App security** (though I'll show you how to store API keys securely)
- **Building adaptive apps**
- **Deep linking and URL-based navigation**
- **Publishing Flutter desktop apps**
- **App monetization**
- **App store optimization (ASO) and keyword research**

Where relevant, I'll include links to resources where you can learn more.

## How to make the most of this course

The course follows a linear structure, giving you a clear release plan that covers all the important steps.

While I recommend following from beginning to end, each module will be as self-contained as possible, so feel free to jump around if you're looking for something specific.

This course is both a **learning path** and a **reference guide**. So, you'll also find:

- **Checklists** at the end of each module to ensure you "ticked all the boxes" before moving on.
- **Quizzes** to test your knowledge in many of the lessons.

In this course, you'll find many techniques and step-by-step guides for getting your apps ready for release. However, just reading the guides and watching the videos won't be enough.

If you really want to learn, you need to get your hands dirty and practice.

To help with that, I've created a companion app called **"Flutter Ship"** that you can use as a release checklist.

This is not just a demo you can play with. Rather, I'll share the full source code so you can actively work on this app and apply all the techniques covered in the course.

### Bonus: Notion App Release Checklist

For your convenience, I've also published my Flutter app release checklist as a Notion page:

- [Flutter App Release Checklist (Notion)](https://www.notion.so/)

Feel free to reuse it in your own projects.

### Learning to Walk Before You Can Run

While you could follow along with your own app, I recommend starting with Flutter Ship. Here's why:

- **Focus on learning**: Using my reference app lets you focus on understanding the course material, without hitting too many brick walls with your project.
- **Consolidate later**: Once you've mastered the techniques, you can return to your own projects and apply what you've learned.`,

        markdown: `## Intro to the Starter Project

To get started, please grab the source code for the Flutter Ship app from GitHub and switch to the \`m01-starter\` branch:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/bizz84/flutter_ship_app
cd flutter_ship_app
git switch m01-starter
# Open in VSCode
code .
\`\`\`

Then, open it in your favorite editor (I'll be using VSCode in this course).

### Running the Project

From VSCode, open a terminal and run \`flutter pub get\` to install all the required packages:

\`\`\`bash
flutter pub get
\`\`\`

Then, you can run the app on iOS, Android, or web.

This course will focus on shipping mobile apps, so I recommend using the iOS Simulator or the Android Emulator during development (or, if you prefer, you can run the app on a physical device).

### Troubleshooting

The starter project has been updated to Flutter 3.35 and I verified it works on iOS, Android, and web.

If you have trouble running it, I recommend the following:

- Check the module about **Common Problems and Solutions**.
- Ask a question on the course Discord, including your error log and the \`flutter doctor -v\` output.

### Where to Find All the Source Code

The official source code for this course can be found on GitHub at:

[https://github.com/bizz84/flutter_ship_app/](https://github.com/bizz84/flutter_ship_app/)

On certain lessons, I'll ask you to checkout a specific branch, so you can easily switch to the latest code. Branches are named based on the module number. You'll find instructions about which branch to use inside each module.

This lesson is an introduction to the project we will use in the rest of the course.

> **Note:** In the coming modules, we will introduce features (such as launcher icons, analytics, error monitoring, etc.) that are self-contained and don't affect the existing app functionality. This means you don't need to fully understand the codebase before moving forward. Nevertheless, familiarity with the project structure and app architecture will be handy as you make progress.

### How the App Works

Here's how it works:

1. When the app first starts, it fetches a JSON template from a Gist that contains all the tasks in the release checklist, and stores them in a local database using **Drift & SQLite**.
2. Once you create a new app and navigate to the details screen, you'll see a checklist with all the tasks that are stored in the DB.
3. Then, you can mark individual tasks as completed, just as you would do in a regular TODO app, and the completion status gets updated in the DB.

### Packages in Use

If you open the \`pubspec.yaml\` file, you'll see these key packages:

\`\`\`yaml
dependencies:
  # Drift and friends
  drift: 2.29.0
  drift_dev: 2.29.0
  path_provider: 2.1.5
  sqlite3_flutter_libs: 0.5.40
  sqlite3: 2.9.4
  # Other packages
  flex_color_scheme: 8.3.1
  flutter_riverpod: 3.0.3
  riverpod_annotation: 3.0.3
  shared_preferences: 2.5.3
  auto_size_text: 3.0.0
  package_info_plus: 9.0.0
  dio: 5.9.0
\`\`\`

The most important ones are:

- **Drift**: Local data storage is an essential requirement for this app, accomplished with the Drift & SQLite packages
- **Riverpod**: Used for dependency injection, data caching, and reactive UI rebuilds

Both Drift and Riverpod use code generation with the underlying \`build_runner\` package. The starter project already contains all the generated files, so you're good to go.

### Project Structure and App Architecture

The app uses a simple **layer-first** structure with three main layers: **data**, **domain**, and **presentation**.

### Data Tables and Their Relationships

There are four tables in total:

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Task** and **Epic** | Represent the JSON template data loaded from a Gist. Synced with the DB on startup. |
| **App** | Contains all the apps created by the user. |
| **TaskStatus** | Contains all the tasks completed by the user (toggling checkboxes). |

### Other Project Folders

In addition to the data, domain, and presentation layers, you'll find:

- **App startup logic**: stored inside \`lib/src/app_startup.dart\` — contains logic for syncing the remote JSON template with the local DB, and retrying in case of errors.
- **Theming**: \`app_theme_data.dart\` and \`app_theme_mode.dart\` define all theming logic, based on the \`flex_color_scheme\` package.
- **Navigation**: Uses Navigator 1.0 APIs with named routes (no deep linking or URL-based navigation).
- **Assets**: Contains the app icons that we will use to generate launcher icons in Module 2.
